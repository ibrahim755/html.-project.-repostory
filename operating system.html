<center><h1>What is an operating system?</h1>
<p>An <i><b>operating system</b></i> is the <strong>most important software</strong> that runs on a computer.<br>
 It manages the computer&apos;s <strong>memory</strong> and <strong>processes</strong>, as well as all of its <strong>software</strong> and <strong>hardware</strong>.<br>
 It also allows you to <strong>communicate</strong> with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer&apos;s language.<br>
 <strong>Without an operating system, a computer is useless</strong>.<br>

<center><h1>The operating system's job</h1>
<p>Your computer's<i><b> operating system (OS)</b></i> manages all of the<strong> software and<strong> hardware on the computer.<br>
 Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time,<br>
 and they all need to access your computer's <strong>central processing unit<strong> (CPU),<strong> memory, and <strong>storage.<br>
 The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.<br></p>
</center>
<center><h1>Types of operating systems</h1>
<p>Operating systems usually come <strong>pre-loaded</strong> on any computer you buy.<br>
 Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it&apos;s possible to upgrade or even change operating systems.<br>
 The three most common operating systems for personal computers are <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong>,<strong> macOS</strong>, and <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>
 </center><br>
 <center><p>Modern operating systems use a <strong>graphical user interface</strong>, or <strong>GUI</strong> (pronounced <strong>gooey</strong>).<br>
 A GUI lets you use your mouse to click <strong>icons</strong>, <strong>buttons</strong>, and <strong>menus</strong>, and everything is clearly displayed <br>
 on the screen using a combination of <strong>graphics</strong> and <strong>text</strong>.</p>
